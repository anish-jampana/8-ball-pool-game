# Project Proposal: Pool

For this project, I will be using C++ and cinder to develop a game for players to play pool. The project will be
developed in the span of 3 weeks.

## Week 1

During the first week of the project, I will design the layout of the game (pool table, pool balls, etc.) and create a
simple loading screen. The loading screen will have different buttons for the user to start playing the game, viewing
instructions, etc. Perhaps the most difficult part of Week 1 is setting up the loading screen such that the playing
screen responds appropriately. For example, the game should switch to the game activity when pressing start, switch to
the instructions activity when pressing instructions, etc.

## Week 2

During the second week of the project, I will mostly design the game engine and include things like ball collisions,
pool cue (a pool stick)
collisions with ball, among other things like maintaining score, and having my program accurately recognize the holes on
the pool table. I will also, most importantly, make sure input functionalities work properly such as dragging the the
pool cue and releasing as well as clicking the buttons on the screen.

## Week 3

During the third week of the project, the aim is to add a cool little feature of my own to the pool game. Specifically,
for my project, I plan to implement a second/different version of the pool game that the user can choose in the starting
menu. This can be bumper pool or one pocket pool or some other format that makes the traditional game either easier or
harder for the player to win.
